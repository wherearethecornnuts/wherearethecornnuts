    <h4> <a href = "https://www.crimemuseum.org/crime-library/famous-murders/charles-manson-and-the-manson-family/"> CHARLES MANSON</a> </h4>
    <p>Charles Milles Manson (November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal and cult leader. In mid-1967, he formed what became known as the Manson Family, a quasi-commune based in California. Manson's followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. According to the Los Angeles County district attorney, Manson plotted to start a race war, though Manson and others involved long disputed this motive. In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people. Although the prosecution conceded that Manson never literally ordered the murders, they contended that his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy. Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman, and Donald Shae.</p>

    <p> John Wayne Gacy (March 17, 1942 to May 10, 1994) was an American serial killer and rapist who took the lives of at least 33 young males in Cook County, Illinois, burying most under his home. Gacy had an abusive childhood and struggled with his sexuality. After being convicted of sexual assault in 1968, his murders were uncovered. Although he maintained his innocence, he was found guilty in 1980 and given multiple death penalty and life sentences. In 1994, he was executed by lethal injection.</p>

		 <h4> <a href = "https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/jeffrey-dahmer"> JEFFREY DAHMER </a> </h4>
    <p>Jeffrey Dahmer (May 21, 1960 to November 28, 1994) was an American serial killer who took the lives of 17 males between 1978 and 1991. Over the course of more than 13 years, Dahmer sought out men, mostly African-American, at gay bars, malls and bus stops, lured them home with promises of money or sex, and gave them alcohol laced with drugs before strangling them to death. He would then engage in sex acts with the corpses before dismembering them and disposing of them, often keeping their skulls or genitals as souvenirs. He frequently took photos of his victims at various stages of the murder process, so he could recollect each act afterward and relive the experience. Dahmer was captured in 1991 and sentenced to 16 life terms. He was killed by fellow prison inmate Christopher Scarver in 1994.</p>

		 <h4> <a href = "https://www.biography.com/crime-figure/ted-bundy"> TED BUNDY</a> </h4>
    <p>Theodore "Ted" Bundy (November 24, 1946 to January 24, 1989) was a 1970s serial murderer, rapist and necrophiliac. He was executed in Florida's electric chair in 1989. His case has since inspired many novels and films about serial killers. Ted Bundy admitted to 36 killings of young women across several states in the 1970s, but experts believe that the final tally may be closer to 100 or more. The exact number of women Bundy killed will never been known. </p>

    <h4> <a href = "https://allthatsinteresting.com/pedro-rodrigues-filho"> PEDRO RODRIGUES FILHO </a> </h4>
    <p> Pedro Rodrigues Filho is one serious serial killer. He’s responsible for at least 70 murders, 10 of which he committed before he reached the age of 18. When it comes to Pedro Rodrigues Filho though, being a good guy can actually pay off. Rodrigues targeted victims who, for the most part, weren’t just average everyday people, he targeted other killers, rapists and domestic abusers. Described by one analyst as the “perfect psychopath,” Rodrigues went after other criminals and those who had wronged him.</p>
